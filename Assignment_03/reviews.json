On the other hand, if it was removed, then the flashlight would roll freely on any surface on which one might lay it - which would NOT be \"desirable\".  So, at least the pocket-clip keeps the otherwise completely round flashlight from rolling when layed-down.All in all, I LIKE 'em - a LOT!  :-)","with_pic":0,"with_video":0}

So I find myself looking for smaller but strong and bright flashlights. These led flashlights from rockbirds are the perfect choice for my family. They are small and very sturdy. Strong and very bright. There are what I would call 3 different modes of light. The first is a regular flashlight beam. This light is very bright and shows a long distance from the user. Next is a more.focused beam just pull on the flashlight and you get a smaller more focused beam of light in a square. Next is a flashing mode. I like this one best because I will take the dogs for a walk in the morning before it is light out and I can use this in flashing mode attach it to my jacket so that drivers can see me.Overall I have been very impressed with the quality of this flashlight.

If you turn it off and on you will have bright light, dimmer light, and the strobe mode and it's somewhat annoying when you're trying to just use a damn flashlight and have to turn it off and on just to get the right light or at least not turn on in strobe mode.

Something is rattling around inside, it won't zoom in all the way any more, and there are two rubber band like things that (I'm guessing) used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn't working any more.  My work backpack has a pocket on the shoulder strap. It had been in that pocket for maybe a month before I discovered it had broken.This flashlight is not rugged. Not even a little.  If clipping it on an office worker's backpack for a month breaks something... Well let's just say I'm glad I didn't get into a situation where I was relying on this light. Very glad.Oh, and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty, how to return it, etc.  Honestly, I wouldn't accept a replacement. Only a refund.One other and less important gripe: The pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything.  That's why I put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap. I couldn't even get the clip over the edge of my jeans pocket without using a tool to pry it open.Move on...get something else. Anything.

Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried  pushing the button one last time. It worked again! Probably some debris inside the switch worked free. I was going to ask the seller for a new switch as the problem could occur again at some inconvenient future time.","with_pic":0,"with_video":0}

One of the push button toggle switches works only when it feels like it - and it's not often it feels like it.  The other 3 flashlights work okay, but I wonder how long before their push button toggle switch craps out.This is the first time in 14 years of shopping with Amazon that a product we purchased doesn't work.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.It's not worth the hassle to send a $4 flashlight back. It should be thrown away, but then I'm throwing away $4 of my money.

I always used the strobe because it is more conspicuous and drains the battery less than a steady beam, and is legal for a bike headlight in Florida. At first I was very happy with the brightness, but after 2-3wks. the light would require many clicks of the switch to turn on. Then it would go dark during my trip, and afterwards it wouldn't come on at all. This started after a total use of less than 3hrs. in strobe function, and the battery still had plenty of charge. I tried the 2nd light, and had a similar experience. Not wanting to continue risking my life, I tried to return the item, but it was not eligable.
